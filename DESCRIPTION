Description: Various utilities are provided that might be used in spatial statistics and elsewhere. It delivers a method for solving linear equations that checks the sparsity of the matrix before any algorithm is used. In particular the following algorithms are implemented: the pivoted Cholesky decomposition <doi:10.1016/j.apnum.2011.10.001> and on graphic cards, the Struve functions <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-1993-1176713-8>, and a precise algorithm for evaluating the special covariance function.
